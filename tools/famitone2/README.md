# Famitone2

This library is actually integrated with neslib, so we don't need most of it. That said, we do need its
converter to turn your music into asm. 

## Windows users

Extract famitone2.zip here. We'll use the windows binaries in the tools/ folder.

## Other OSes

Extract famitone2.zip here. Next, compile the 3 utilities that have executables in tools/ and put the binaries into
the tools folder. They should have the same names as the windows ones, except without the extension.
